        <h2>The Blue-Footed Booby: A Biopic</h2>
        <p>The Blue-Footed Booby (Sula nebouxii) is one of nature's most entertaining and charismatic seabirds. Renowned for their brilliantly colored blue feet and comical courtship dances, these birds are a highlight of the Galápagos Islands and the Pacific coast of South America.</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Growing up to 32 inches (81 cm) in length with a wingspan of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), these large seabirds have brown bodies with white bellies and distinctive bright blue feet. The intensity of the blue in their feet is a sign of health and nutrition - the brighter the blue, the healthier the bird. Their long, pointed beaks are perfectly adapted for diving into the ocean to catch fish.</p>
        
        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Blue-Footed Boobies are found along the Pacific coasts of Central and South America, with the majority living in the Galápagos Islands. They prefer arid, rocky coastlines and volcanic islands where they can nest in open areas and have easy access to the ocean for fishing.</p>
        
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>These birds are expert plunge divers, catching fish like sardines, anchovies, and mackerel by diving from heights of up to 100 feet (30 meters) at speeds around 60 mph (97 km/h). Their streamlined bodies allow them to slice through the water to catch prey with incredible precision.</p>
        
        <h3>Intelligence and Behavior</h3>
        <p>The Blue-Footed Booby is famous for its elaborate courtship ritual. Males show off their bright blue feet by lifting them in a high-stepping strut, accompanied by sky-pointing displays and wing-spreading to impress females. They are also known for their distinctive whistling call and excellent diving abilities. These birds have binocular vision that helps them judge distances when diving for fish.</p>
        
        <h3>Breeding</h3>
        <p>Blue-Footed Boobies form monogamous pairs during breeding season. They lay 1-3 eggs in shallow ground nests, with both parents taking turns incubating the eggs with their feet (using their webbed feet like a warming blanket). The incubation period lasts about 41-45 days. Chicks are fed by both parents through regurgitation and fledge after about 100 days.</p>
        
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>Listed as Least Concern, Blue-Footed Boobies have an estimated global population of several hundred thousand breeding pairs. However, they are vulnerable to climate change and El Niño events, which affect fish populations and their food supply. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their breeding grounds and maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems.</p>
