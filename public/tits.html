        <h2>The Great Tit: A Biopic</h2>
        <p>The Great Tit (Parus major) is one of the most fascinating birds in the avian world. This charismatic bird, found across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa, has captured the hearts of birdwatchers and scientists alike.</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Measuring about 14 cm in length, the Great Tit is the largest of the British tit species. It boasts a striking black head, neck, and throat with white cheeks. The back is olive-green, and the underparts are bright yellow with a black stripe running down the center of the breast. Males typically have broader black stripes than females.</p>
        
        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Great Tits are highly adaptable birds that can thrive in a variety of environments, from deciduous and mixed woodlands to parks, gardens, and even urban areas. Their ability to adapt has made them one of the most widespread bird species in Europe.</p>
        
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>These omnivorous birds have a diverse diet, feeding on insects, caterpillars, spiders, seeds, nuts, and berries. During winter, they're frequent visitors to bird feeders, where their bold and curious nature makes them a delight to watch.</p>
        
        <h3>Intelligence and Behavior</h3>
        <p>Great Tits are among the most intelligent songbirds, capable of learning complex tasks and problem-solving. They have an impressive repertoire of up to 40 different calls and songs, with regional dialects unique to their breeding areas. Studies have shown they can manipulate tools and even open milk bottles!</p>
        
        <h3>Breeding</h3>
        <p>These cavity-nesting birds typically breed in tree holes, nest boxes, or other enclosed spaces. The female lays 6-10 eggs, incubating them for about 2 weeks. Both parents work tirelessly to feed the hungry chicks, which fledge after another 18-21 days.</p>
        
        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>With an estimated population of 44-60 million breeding pairs in Europe alone, Great Tits are classified as Least Concern. Their adaptability and widespread distribution ensure their continued presence in our gardens and woodlands for generations to come.</p>
